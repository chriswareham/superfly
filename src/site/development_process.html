<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p>The source code can be retrieved from the Subversion repository with the
command <code>svn checkout http://www.chriswareham.net/svn/repos/trunk/superfly</code>.
This will produce a directory called <code>superfly</code> in the current
working directory that contains the Ant build script, <code>build.xml</code>.
Running the command <code>ant help</code> in the <code>superfly</code> directory
will produce a list of the most important build targets, as well as a list of
some of the build properties that may be overridden from the command line. In
additional to the most important build targets, others include <code>checkstyle</code>
for checking conformance with the coding conventions, <code>whitespace</code>
for ensuring Java source files follow Unix line ending conventions, and <code>docs</code>
for producing an archive of JavaDoc files.</p>
<p>The coding convention used is based on <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">Sun's
Code Convention</a>. It differs in the use of four spaces for each level of
indentation, and lines longer than eighty characters in length not needing to be
wrapped. Before committing changes to the source repository, conformance with
the coding conventions should be checked by running the command <code>ant
checkstyle</code>. This runs the <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>
tool, which produces a log file called <code>checkstyle_errors.log</code>. All
fields and methods, regardless of scope, must have JavaDoc comments describing
their purpose. Parameters to methods should be declared <code>final</code>
wherever possible, as this eliminates a potential source of confusion when
non-final parameters are reassigned within a method.</p>
<p>String concatenation should generally be avoided by using buffers, especially
in loops, although common sense should be used to ensure that over zealous
adherence to this convention does not clutter the code. Note that the
<code>StringBuilder</code> class should be used in preference to the
<code>StringBuffer</code> one, unless the synchronised methods of the latter
class are definitely required. Logging statements should generally use string
concatenation and be wrapped in a <em>logger guard</em> to prevent needless
creation of string objects when the code is run at lower logging levels.
Although this causes there to be two method calls when logging is enabled at the
specified level or higher, it avoids the needless creation of
<code>String</code> objects. For example:</p>
<pre class="boxed">
    <strong>if</strong> (LOGGER.isInfoEnabled()) {
        LOGGER.info("A logging statement using string concatenation: " <strong>+</strong> str);
    }

    LOGGER.info("A logging statement not using string concatenation, so a guard is unnecessary");
</pre>
<p>All code should be written with thread safety in mind - for instance, parsing
and formatting classes from the <code>java.text</code> package are not
guaranteed to be thread safe and should not be made instance members in code
that can be called concurrently by multiple threads.</p>
<p>Line endings in text files should use the Unix format of a single line feed
character. If using a windows based IDE or text editor, it should be configured
to create new files in this format, and to honour the format of existing files.
For the Eclipse IDE the following changes should be made to the preferences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <em>Workspace</em> preferences pane by choosing <em>General:
Workspace</em> from the menus.</li>
<li>Change the <em>Text Encoding</em> preference to "UTF-8".</li>
<li>Change the <em>New Text File Line Delimiter</em> preference to "Other" and
choose "Unix".</li>
</ol>
<p>To convert the line endings of an existing file in Eclipse, choose <em>File :
Convert Line Delimiters to : Unix</em> from the menus. Running the command
<code>ant whitespace</code> will also convert the line endings in Java source
files.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>New functionality should be developed on a branch in the Subversion
repository, with regular merging from the trunk to simplify an eventual merge
back to the trunk. Bug fixes or other small scale improvements to existing
functionality should be developed on the trunk, unless it involves work of an
invasive or experimental nature - put simply, common sense should be used to
decide how likely it is that a change will result in breakage, if such a
likelihood is high then the work should be conducted on a branch. Every commit
should be preceded by running the <code>ant checkstyle</code> command and fixing
any coding convention conformance issues.</p>
<p>A branch may be created using the following Subversion commands:</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>svn copy http://www.chriswareham.net/svn/repos/trunk/superfly \
           http://www.chriswareham.net/svn/repos/branches/<em>branch_name</em> \
           -m "<em>description</em>"</strong>
</pre>
<p>Where <em>branch_name</em> is a succinct name for the branch, and
<em>description</em> briefly describes the purpose of the branch.</p>
<p>Merging from the trunk to a branch is accomplished with the following
Subversion commands, having first ensured that all branch changes are committed
(the command <code>svn status</code> can be used to check):</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>svn merge ^/trunk/superfly</strong>
</pre>
<p>Merging a branch back into the trunk is accomplished in a clean, upto date
copy of the trunk, with the following Subversion commands:</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>svn merge --reintegrate http://www.chriswareham.net/svn/repos/branches/<em>branch_name</em></strong>
$ <strong>svn commit -m "Merge the <em>branch_name</em> branch"</strong>
</pre>
<p>Once it is redundant, a branch can be deleted with the following Subversion
command:</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>svn delete http://www.chriswareham.net/svn/repos/branches/<em>branch_name</em> \
             -m "Delete the <em>branch_name</em> branch"</strong>
</pre>
<p>Note that the branch is not actually deleted, but effectively hidden after
running this command.</p>
<h2>Code Structure</h2>
<p>The classes in the code base are structured into three architectural tiers -
data access, business logic and presentation. All data access and business logic
classes define <em>behaviour</em> - they actually do something - whereas beans
should be purely data classes that simply store information and do not define
behaviour. All data access and business logic classes must not rely on running
in a web application container such as Tomcat, and should be coded to interfaces
and accompanied by <em>unit tests</em> that cover all their interface methods.
The tool used for unit testing is <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>, the
de-facto standard for Java. Whether unit tests are written before the
implementation code, so called <em>Test Driven Development</em>, is up to the
individual developer. However in the experience of the author, interfaces are
usually written first, as tests are grouped around each interface method - it is
the API defined in an interface that drives the initial declaration of test
methods rather than the other way round.</p>
<p>The code is written around a lightweight framework that is similar to
<a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/">Spring</a> and
<a href="http://picocontainer.codehaus.org/">PicoContainer</a>, and is described in
detail in the <a href="application_architecture.html">application
architecture</a> document. Briefly, the framework relies on an XML file that
describes a number of <em>components</em>. Each component is concerned with data
access or business logic relating to one particular part of the system. On
startup, either as a standalone program or from within a web application
container like Tomcat, the XML file is parsed and the each component
initialised. Components use <em>dependency injection</em> via setters, with
parameters and other components dynamically set by the framework. Components can
also implement a <code>LifecycleComponent</code> interface, which allows them to
be informed when the framework is starting and stopping. Web applications use a
set of classes and interfaces that support the MVC (<em>Model View
Controller</em>) abstraction. The framework provides database connection pooling
without the need for a directory lookup service such as JNDI or support from a
web application container. There are also classes providing memory and disk
based caching of objects without any need for the cached objects to implement a
specific interface or to extend a specific base class.</p>
